# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a **web developer**. It serves as a platform to highlight my work, achievements, and the technologies I've mastered. The portfolio is fully responsive and designed to adapt seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on responsive layouts without using any frameworks like Bootstrap.
- **Projects Section**: A detailed showcase of my web development projects, with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
- **About Me**: An overview of my background, skills, and interests, providing insight into who I am as a developer.
- **Contact Form**: A simple and functional contact form that allows visitors to get in touch with me easily.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For designing and styling the website, including custom responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and enhance user experience.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for enhancing the design aesthetics.
